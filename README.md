<u>Project 2</u>

Objective: This purpose of this project is to implement databases into a Full stack application.

<ol>

 <li>Application

  <ol>

   <li>Must be able to create, read, update, delete in the application.</li>

   <li>Create a login and register page that asks for user to login and access the application. Ability for the user to logout from the session.</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Documentation</li>

</ol>

Form a group of 2 – 4 people this report <u>must</u> consist of the following:

<ol>

 <li>The team member’s names and emails.</li>

 <li>The team name.</li>

</ol>




Describe the software in roughly three paragraphs. Address the following questions:

<ol>

 <li>What is the purpose of the software?</li>

 <li>Why is the software interesting?</li>

 <li>What existing product is like the project you are proposing? Create a complete diagram of the application and how it will work.</li>

</ol>




The schemas for the database the software will be using. Anywhere between 7-12 is typical for a small project, you may have more.




The software application must include a “manual” or “tutorial” of some sort which explains the software’s use and features.




<ol>

 <li>The documentation clearly describes the purpose and design of the software.</li>

 <li>The database must be creatable from SQL scripts, and the schemas must be documented and accompanied by ER diagrams. (Hand drawn and photographed is fine.)</li>

 <li>The schemas are in normal form; they should be in third normal form.</li>

 <li>I should be able use the software to create, update, and delete records describe how you did it in the documentation.</li>

</ol>




While the software does not have to be “bug free”, I should not encounter bugs while performing the documented operations, or variations thereof.
